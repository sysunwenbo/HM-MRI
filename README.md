3. Matlab 2023a or 2023b can direct support the the lsqnonlin with unequal and equal constraints.
4. If you are investigating other tumors rather than brain tumors, please take a look at choosing better intial values and right constraints. They are very important for the fitting.
5. If your scanner is 1.5T, a high TE can be achieved when acquiring the HM-MRI data.
